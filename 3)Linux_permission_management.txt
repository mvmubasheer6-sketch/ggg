in two way we can assign permission
-----------------------------------
a) absolute mode
b) symbolic mode

3 type of entity and 3 types of access mode
USER, group, other users
read write execution

what is read -> user can read content of file
what is write -> user can modify file
what is execution -> user can run that file (eg: shell script file, or exe file)

rwx rwx rwx
421 421 421
 7   7   7

0 - no permission
1 - execution permission
2 - write permission
3 - write and execution permission
4 - read permission
5 - read and execution permission
6 - read and write permission
7 - read, write and execution permission(ALL permission are allowed)

owner full permission, group read, other read?

user group other users

-rwx rwx rwx
| |   |   |------ other users
| |   |
| |   |---------- groups
| |
| |-------------- current user (owner of file/directory)
|
|---------------- regular file(-) directories(d)


create custom permission for user
-----------------------------------
chmod 777 filename - all permission for all entities


symbolic mode
--------------
symbolic mode
--------------
u -> user
g -> group
o -> other users
a -> all
= -> assigning 
+ -> adding
- -> removing

chmod u+r file
chmod ugo+rwx file

chown(ownership of file)
-------------------------
chown username:groupname filename

chgrp chnage group
------
to chnage group permission, can use "chgrp ec2-user filename"

setfacl (set fire wall access control list) and getfacl (set fire wall access control list)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
getfacl - to get permission information of file or directory
setfacl - to set permission for files/directory

setfacl -m u:username:rwx filename

sticky bit
-----------
When a directory's sticky bit is set, root user or file owner only can delete the file, hence it helps to prevent unintentional delete of file
chmod 0000 file

umask user file-creation mode mask
-----
to determine the file permission for newly created files. 
execute umask
set new umask - umask 0222
