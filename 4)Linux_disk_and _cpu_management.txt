NICE
Linux can run a lot of processes at a time, which can slow down the speed of some high priority processes and result in poor performance.
To avoid this, you can tell your machine to prioritize processes as per your requirements. -20 to 0

syntax
------
renice nice-value -p pid

lst all process
---------------
ps -e
ps -ef

ps -ax
ps -axu

ps -ef | grep name

ps pid -> chekc status of process

find pid of process
-------------------
pidof process_name

how to kill process
--------------------
